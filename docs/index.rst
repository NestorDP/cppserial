Welcome to CppSerial's documentation!
=====================================

CppSerial is a C++ library for serial communication on Linux systems. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for opening, configuring, and communicating through serial ports.

The goal of this API is to provide developers with a modern C++ interface to the traditional C header asm/termbits.h.
It allows setting any baud rate supported by the hardware, not just the standard ones, enabling a more flexible communication process that is ideal for industrial or embedded applications requiring non-standard baud rates.
It uses **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**, **smart pointers**, **lambda functions**, and more to give your applications greater flexibility and power when dealing with **serial communication** in a **Linux environment**.
